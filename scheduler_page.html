    <h2>Restaurant Scheduling Project</h2>
    <section class="presentation-section">
        <p>
            In the summer of 2024 I interned at Leaf & Grain, a healthy salad resturant in Houston Texas as a strategic analyist. My final project was to build a scheduling algorithum that would take in numerious inputs such as employee availability, ability and company constraints both financial and operational. To solve such a problem, I applied methods from linear optimization solvers on python. 

        <p>    This project was spit up into 3 files with correlated purposes: 
            <p>    1. Scheduler.py searches for optimal function and outputs data into schedule_data.json file at the location of the program 
                <p>2. API_interface.py grabs data from google sheet (this will automatically run with software)
                    <p>3. API_paster.py pastes schedule_data.json information back into scheduler sheet
        </p>
