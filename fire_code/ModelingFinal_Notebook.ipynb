    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For my final project, I attempted to model a fire burning in a 5 by 5-meter room, and how a fire sprinkler system may dampen the effects. Although there are many rooms out there that are not 5 by 5 meters, this code is a fundamental model that can be used to make extrapolations about larger rooms by assuming a sprinkler covers each portion of the large room. As always there were such drawbacks with this project as there is no specific formula to represent the characteristics of fire. Like most objects in the real world, fire is a chaotic system with multiple initial conditions and parameters affecting it. For simplicity, I focused on measuring the heat release rate of the fire. Heat release rate, HRR for short, measures the intensity at which a fire releases energy. HRR is measured in Watts; however, due to the magnitude of the fire, I will be working in Kilowatts.\n"

    "## Background\n",
    "There is no specific motivation for this project. When looking for inspiration, I was laying in bed looking up at the ceiling. I noticed the fire sprinkler and how it is unnoticeably a part of every room we step into. I wondered how challenging it would be to model something so embedded into our life that we rarely stop to notice it. There was lots of data in some aspects of the project such as how much water is released from a fire sprinkler, but less information in facets such as how to properly model a water droplet engulfed in flames.\n"

    "## Format\n",
    "The project was split into a 'main file' and 4 separate files to simplify for convenience. I will highlight the key importance of each file and how it has to lead to a final representation. Along with the 'main file,' there is a file running an Ising Model, projectile motion simulation, water droplet iterations, and plotting functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structure used for this project was an array. This is because I needed to hold information for each section in the room. To simplify the model, I divided the room into smaller subsections that help its position in the array. This position can vary between trials as the dimensions of the room and stepsize dividing the room can change. To create a more accurate model I could increase the number of times the room is divided; However, this will lead to longer computation times. "

    "As highlighted by the name, the 'main file' is the most important section of the code. Although every file plays a crucial part, the 'main file' calls up the other files and drives the program. In addition, this file initializes the arrays and sets the initial conditions to later be called in each file."

    "The portion of the code below imports all of the needed libraries for the 'main file' in addition to setting some structure. The code sets the dimensions of the array and how the floor will be divided into a grid where the position will have a value in the arrays. The Ising array is initialized and first assumed that each position on the floor is not on fire. Next, we find the center of the room and position the sprinkler here. If I wanted to model a different room, I could change the dimensions of the room or the position of the sprinkler. By defining each variable the code is flexible to model more than a 5 by 5-meter room with the sprinkler directly in the middle.\n",

    "First, the Ising model file will be implemented to the driving iterator because every second the fire will spread. In reality, the fire is spreading continually and not at discrete time steps. I used the structure of the Ising model from our class's Ising model project. the major difference is that a position in the array in question may flip its spin due to the interaction with a position to its diagonal. Normally in an Ising model, the positions above, below, to the left, and the right can affect the spin-flip. However since fire can spread from any sort of touch, therefore the diagonal positions must be accounted for as well. The other major difference is that the positions can only flip to -1 but not back to 1. This means that once a position is on fire it will not quickly become not on fire. This makes intuitive sense because surrounding positions that are not on fire do not incline a position that is on fire to somehow stop burning. Fire is contagious, while a non-fire state is not.\n",

    "### Droplet Iterator\n",
    "The next file that must be introduced is the droplet iterator file. This file finds exactly how many droplets are ejected out of the sprinkler each second and projects where it lands. The number of droplets per second, $50,000$, was found by first finding the number of liters per minute released. I was able to convert this to droplets per second by assuming that this is pure $H_2O$ and therefore $1 ml$ of water has a mass of $1g$. Also, via Google search, I needed to learn that a droplet has a mass of about $0.05g$. Once I know that there are $50,000$ droplets released every second, I randomize the distance and direction in which each droplet is projected. I use the max droplet distance from the projectile motion file. I randomized the projection by importing the random library. When the array lands in a specific position on the floor, the droplet is accounted for in the floor_water array.\n",

    "## The Driving Iterator\n",

Since the arrays are all the same size, the iterator will be able to look at each array (floor_hrr, floor_water, floor_time, and ising_floor). First, the code creates a heatmap, calls the rising floor file to have the fire spread some, and projects the $50,000$ water droplets adding energy to the floor_water array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the iterator will look through each position in the array. First, the code will find any position that is now on fire and was not in the prior iteration. These newly ignited positions will have time recorded in the floor_time array so that I can calculate how long the position has been on fire. Second, the code tracked the HRR value of each position that is considered on fire. The long formula used to calculate the HRR over time was found in a publication by the US Department of Commerce on the heat release rate characteristics for different sources found in a nuclear power plant. This paper provided data such as the peak HRR and when it would occur. By plotting my graph with the provided information and using Microsoft Excel, I was able to derive an equation representing the HRR as a function of time.\n",

    "## Drawbacks/Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, the biggest challenge was learning about the science of fire. This is not a widely acknowledged subfield in physics and it becomes very chaotic very quickly. Using the energy of water to reduce the HRR of the fire is a respectable analysis; however, this does not account for the fact that the water creates a wet surface that inhibits the fire from flourishing. The only way to improve my analysis in this sense is to completely change the equations used to model fire. This is challenging but not impossible. The US Department of Commerce mentioned a formula:\n",
    "$$ \\dot{Q}=\\dot{m} * H_{T} * x_{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat release based on mass loss. $\\dot{m}$ is the rate of mass loss (kg/s). $H_{T}$ is the net heat of complete combustion (KJ/g). $x_{A}$ is the combustion efficency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to improve the code would be to change the layout of the room. At the moment, each position of the room burns at the same rate. In reality, this is not true because rooms have furniture in some positions which will have a greater peak HRR compared to the area that is empty and only the hardwood floor is burning. To change this I would have to have different HRR concerning time functions for differing positions."

My simulation may not be the same as experimental data, but that is because there is chaos in the real world which is somewhat impossible to account for. The physics of fire is rarely incorporated in academia and I believe my code could be a great introduction to both physics coupled with fire along with physics implemented in Python.\n"
