    "# Background\n",
    "In the summer of 2024 I interned at Leaf & Grain, a healthy salad resturant in Houston Texas as a strategic analyist. My final project was to build a scheduling algorithum that would take in numerious inputs such as employee availability, ability and company constraints both financial and operational. To solve such a problem, I applied methods from linear optimization solvers on python. \n",

    "6. No breaks - this is only in scheduler; managers will allot breaks \n",
    "7. Start time - fixes edge case of employees starting at 6 am \n",
    "8. Total labor hours - goal to hold us under labor budget, but objective function is to minimize hrs so keep this at infinity\n",
