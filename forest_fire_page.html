        <h2>Forest Fire Model</h2>
        <section class="presentation-section">
        <p>In my sophmore year simulation and modeling course, I modeled forest fires using monte carlo and ising techniques. Firstly, we set a coupling constant (spread rate) for the fire that was relatively low, and then we evaluated what portion of the forest had been engulfed by the fire. Secondly, once the majority of the forest was on fire, we could learn how many time steps or iterations of the process this took. Some general assumptions were made when building this code to limit its complexity and manage our outcomes. Once a tree is on fire, it can not be put out or change states. In reality, obviously this is not true, a fire can be usually be put out or grow back overtime; however, we are assuming that our model is running over a short period of time, thus no regrowth, and no firefighters present to smother the flames.<p>
            <p>After the simulation is complete I show a plot of the forest in which red is burnt sections while green are unhurts areas. Additonally, I present the engery of the model as it developes through time.  </p>
