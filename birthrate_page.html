        <h2>Modeling Birthrates</h2>
        <section class="presentation-section">
        <p>In my simulation and modeling course, my partner Phin Schmit and I modeled birthrates using the concepts of population dynamics and multiple differential equation.</p>
        <p>We decided to model the number of births in the U.S. during the years 2010-2020. Our motivation to undertake the task of creating this model was to hopefully prove that a model typically used for the spread of disease can be used to make predictions about something that is not infectious. Although there is no such thing as 'baby fever', we were still able to create a generally accurate model for our purposes. Pregnancy was an ideal subject to create a model for because because of its binary nature; an individual is either pregnant or not, there is no inbetween. In this way it is comparable to disease; one is either sick or not sick. Despite the initial uncertainty of using an SIR-type model for our project, we are now glad we did.</p>
